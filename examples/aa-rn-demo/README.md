There is a good example by default on `HomeScreen`. You can delete the all screens.

- `npm i`
- `npm i && npx pod-install`
- `react-native run-ios/android`

**OR**

- `npm i`
- `npx pod-install` (iOS Only)
- `react-native run-ios/android`

### Install Pods (iOS Only)

- `npm i`
- `cd ios && pod install`
- `cd .. && react-native run-ios/android`

### Android local.properties (Android Only)

- `npm i`
- `cd android && mkdir local.properties`
- `nano local.properties`
